# NFT-based Social Profile

## Project Title
NFT-based Social Profile

## Project Description
NFT-based Social Profile is a decentralized platform where users can mint NFTs that represent their online profiles and social status. Each user can create a unique digital identity by minting NFTs, where each NFT holds the user's profile information such as title, description, and other metadata.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to build a decentralized, tamper-proof digital identity system, where users have full ownership and control over their social profiles. These NFTs will represent more than just a digital collectible, but a verifiable identity tied to the userâ€™s social presence on the blockchain.

## Future Scope
- **Interoperability**: The platform can be expanded to support integration with other platforms, such as social media or web3-based applications, to allow users to use their NFTs across multiple platforms.
- **Advanced Profile Features**: Adding more metadata to the NFTs like social media links, profile pictures, and achievements.
- **DAO Integration**: The ability for users to manage their social profile NFTs collectively through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
- **NFT Marketplace**: Allow users to trade or auction their social profile NFTs on a dedicated marketplace.

## Key Features
- **Minting of NFTs**: Users can mint an NFT that represents their social profile.
- **Profile Information**: Each NFT holds information about the user's profile, including a title and description.
- **Decentralized Ownership**: Users have full ownership of their profile and its data, stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Customizable Metadata**: Users can set unique titles and descriptions for their profiles.
- **On-chain Data**: The social profile data (title, description) is stored on the blockchain ensuring immutability and transparency.
